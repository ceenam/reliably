Custom Solution using Bootstrap Dashboard Template powered by [chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/)

## Survey of Tools

[keen dashboards](https://github.com/keen/dashboards)
simple js and bootstrap based dashboards that are customizable. 
Data can be fed from any source and templates served with say Flask or 
what have you.

[metabase](https://metabase.com/)
Mature, fully featured solution that's Java based. Though there's a containerized version and setup, involves no coding it seems...

[smashing](https://github.com/Smashing/smashing)
Ruby based project with widgets, deployment on Heroku, and lots of contributors.
Seems to be the successor to the well-known, but now deprecated Dashing project by Shopify.

[bowtie](https://github.com/jwkvam/bowtie)
simple seeming tool in Python for generating dashboards (example deployed on Heroku)
(maybe too simple and not beautiful?)

[Grafana](https://grafana.com/)
popular tool, written in Go (used on my previous team). 
dashboard is built manually with button clicks via a system installation

~[mozaik](https://github.com/plouc/mozaik)~
Design is a bit unprofessional
node.js and react based dashboard tool

[freeboard](https://github.com/Freeboard/freeboard)
node.js based tool, only supports event data, not reading from a database.

[Stashboard](http://www.stashboard.org/)
by Twilio, written in Python, but seems coupled to Google Cloud's App engine.


~[Dashing](https://github.com/Shopify/dashing)~
Previously used by Shopify, but no longer maintained!
